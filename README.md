# Simple To-Do List Web Application for ISYS3001 Assessment 2

## Project Overview

This repository contains a simple, client-side To-Do List web application developed as part of ISYS3001 Assessment 2. The application demonstrates fundamental web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) alongside key software configuration management practices, including version control with Git and GitHub, and simulated procurement management.

The To-Do List application allows users to:
*   Add new tasks to the list.
*   Mark tasks as completed/uncompleted.
*   Delete tasks from the list.
*   Persistently store tasks in the browser's `localStorage`, so data is not lost on page refresh.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For implementing all interactive functionalities and local storage management.
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **GitHub:** For hosting the remote repository and collaboration.
*   **Visual Studio Code:** As the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Configuration Management Practices

This project strictly followed configuration management principles:

1.  **Version Control (Git & GitHub):** All source code changes were meticulously tracked using Git. The project repository on GitHub serves as the central hub for code management.
    *   **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/fantastic129432-maker/24832481_A2_To-Do-List` 
    *   **GitHub Username:** `fantastic129432-maker` 
2.  **Branching Strategy:** A feature branching model was adopted. Each significant new feature or modification was developed on a dedicated branch, which was then merged into the `main` branch upon completion and local verification. This ensured a stable `main` codebase.
3.  **Commit Messages:** Commit messages were kept descriptive and followed a conventional prefix system (e.g., `Initial commit:`, `Feat:`, `Style:`) to clearly articulate the nature and purpose of each change.
4.  **Deployment Configuration:** The application is a static web page and can be served directly from the file system or hosted on static site hosting platforms like GitHub Pages. Instructions for local setup are provided below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
*   Git installed on your local machine.
*   A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fantastic129432-maker/24832481_A2_To-Do-List.git
    ```
    (Replace with your actual repository URL)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd 24832481_A2_To-Do-List
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer.

    Alternatively, if you have VS Code, you can right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server" (if you have the Live Server extension installed) for a better development experience.
